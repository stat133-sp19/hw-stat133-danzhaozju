# Workout 01: GSW Shot Charts
## Purpose:
1. From the logistical point of view, this assignment will give you the opportunity to start working with a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub  

2. From the analytics point of view, this HW involves visualizing shot data of NBA players. More especifically, you will be producing so-called “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations.  

3. From the report/communication standpoint, you will have to produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.  

## 1) File Structure  
Follow the general instructions and organize the file structure as required.

## 2) Data  
Download the data and create a data dictionary including the variables and their description.  

## 3) Data Preparation
create a csv data file shots-data.csv that will contain the required variables to be used in the visualization phase.  

## 4) Shot Charts  
Create a scatterplot of the shots based on the coordinates with the image of a NBA court as the background.  

## 5) Report  
write an article
about the shooting statistics of the five GSW players: Iguodala, Green, Durant, Thompson,
and Curry.
