# Cooking Recipe
## [Boozy Baked French Toast](https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/12/new-years-day-2001/)
### 1. The Ingredients
* 1 loaf supermarket Challah bread in 1-inch slices, no need for the super-fancy stuff here
* 3 cups whole milk
* 3 eggs
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt  

### 2. "Special" Kitchen Tools
* 9×13-inch baking dish
* pan
* oven
* cling film
* egg beater  

### 3. Steps
1. Generously grease a 9×13-inch baking dish with salted (my choice) or unsalted butter.
2. Arrange bread in two tightly-packed layers in the pan. I always cut one slice into smaller pieces to fill in gaps, especially when using braided Challah. If using a thinner-sliced bread, you might wish for more layers, though I find that over three, even baking can be difficult. If you are using any fillings of fruit or nuts, this is the time to get them between the layers or sprinkled atop.
3. Whisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt and booze or flavorings of your choice and pour over the bread. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.
4. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The bread will absorb all of the milk custard while you sleep.
5. Bake at 425 for 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden. This will take longer if you have additional layers.
6. Cut into generous squares and serve with maple syrup, fresh fruit, powdered sugar or all of the above.

### 5. Special Season
There is no special season for this dish. It's a perfect go-to recipe for Saturday morning breakfast! <br/> 

### 6. Variations of the Recipe
**Your choice of flavorings: **  
I use 3 tablespoons Bailey’s and 3 tablespoons Cointreau, but Frangelico (hazelnut), Chambord (raspberry), Creme de Cassis (black currant) Grand Marnier or just a teaspoon or two of vanilla or almond extract can do the trick. 
You can bump up a citrus flavor with a teaspoon of zest, add a half-cup of chopped nuts such as almond slivers or pecans between layers or on top or a similar amount of raisins or other dried fruits.  

# [Euclidean Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)
## Definition  

---  

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them $(\overline{\mathbf{pq}})$.<br/>

In Cartesian coordinates, if $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,p_2,…，p_n)$ and $q=(q_1,q_2,…，q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$ is given by the Pythagorean formula:<br/>

$$\begin{aligned}
d(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{q}) = d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})&= \sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+…+（q_n-p_n)^2}\\&= \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(q_i-p_i)^2}.
\end{aligned} \tag{1}$$<br/>

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-sapce is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or Euclidean length, or magnitude of a vector measures the length of the vector:<br/>

$$\|\mathbf{p}\| = \sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2+…+p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{p}},$$<br/>
where the last expression involves the dot product.<br/>

Describing a vector as a directed line segment from the origin of the Euclidean space (vector tail), to a point in that space (vector tip), its length is actually the distance from its tail to its tip. The Euclidean norm of a vector is seen to be just the Euclidean distance between its tail and its tip.<br/>

The relationship between points **p** and **q** may involve a direction (for example, from **p** to **q**), so when it does, this relationship can itself be represented by a vector, given by<br/>

$$\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p} = (q_1-p_1,q_2-p_2,…，q_n-p_n).$$<br/>

In a two- or three-dimensional space (n = 2, 3), this can be visually represented as an arrow from p to q. In any space it can be regarded as the position of **q** relative to **p**. It may also be called a displacement vector if **p** and **q** represent two positions of some moving point.<br/>

The Euclidean distance between p and q is just the Euclidean length of this displacement vector:<br/>

$$\|\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| = \sqrt{(\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}) \cdot (\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p})}. \tag{2}$$<br/>

which is equivalent to equation 1, and also to:<br/>

$$\|\mathbf{q} - \mathbf{p}\| = \sqrt{\|\mathbf{p}\|^2 + \|\mathbf{q}\|^2 -2\mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{q}}.$$
